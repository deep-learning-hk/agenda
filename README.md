Attention is all you need [paper]
------------------------
- Paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
- Slide deck - https://nlp.stanford.edu/seminar/details/lkaiser.pdf

One Model to Learn them all [paper]
---------------------------
- paper - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05137.pdf
- Chinese explanation - https://blog.csdn.net/shenxiaolu1984/article/details/73736259
- Three main neural net structures:
  1. Depthwise Separable Convolution
  2. Attention
  3. Mixture-of-experts layer
- Main achievements:
  1. Generalize to different tasks in a single model:
    - image
    - text
    - sound
    - classification (output)
  2. Even there are extra components, it won't hinder for other tasks accuracy
- Main concept:
  - use Modality Unit to transform any kind of input into universal representation

Misc
----
- R^2 - Coefficient of Determination
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination
  - Where 1 is the best score
  - 0 is the score as good/bad as the baseline with predicted value as expected value
  - (negative score is the score which is worse than the baseline (expected value)

  - ...constrain the generator by an Autoencoder (AE). We propose a formulation to consider the reconstructed samples from AE as "real" samples for the discriminator. This couples the convergence of the AE with that of the discriminator, effectively slowing down the convergence of discriminator and reducing gradient vanishing. Importantly, we propose two novel distance constraints to improve the generator...
